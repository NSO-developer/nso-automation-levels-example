Permission to use this code as a starting point hereby granted

This module implements an NSO action callback that is used to optimize the running services.
When this action is invoked, it will start a background thread that reads the list of edge services
and (<optimizes>) them one by one at regular intervals (see INTERVAL_TIME below). Invoking the same
action again will make the thread terminate.

See the top level README file for more information
