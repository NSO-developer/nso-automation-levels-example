Permission to use this code as a starting point hereby granted

This module implements an NSO action callback that is used to simulate varying energy prices.
When this action is invoked, it will start a background thread that changes the leaf
/streaming:dc/oper-status/energy-price
in each datacenter (DC) at regular intervals (see INTERVAL_TIME below). Invoking the same
action again will make the thread terminate.

See the top level README file for more information
